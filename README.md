# Salzburg Interactive Map

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive web map of Salzburg using Leaflet. The map highlights restaurant locations with data sourced from OpenStreetMap via Overpass Turbo.

## Data Sources
- Base map from MapTiler (Street View)  
- Salzburg location coordinates from Google Maps  
- Restaurant data (GeoJSON) extracted and refined using Overpass Turbo and geojson.io

## Features
- Interactive popups displaying restaurant types  
- Layer control for toggling map layers  
- Customized styling for better visualization

## Methodology
- Created the base map using Leaflet library  
- Integrated GeoJSON restaurant data after cleaning and filtering  
- Added interactivity with popups and layer control

## Potential Improvements
- Add route animations between restaurants  
- Include user location tracking  
- Enhance styling and add more points of interest

## Reflection
This project improved my understanding of web mapping with Leaflet, handling GeoJSON data, and integrating multiple data sources for effective visualization.
